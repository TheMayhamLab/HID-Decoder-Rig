# HID-Reader

This project was created so I could learn more about Wiegand encoding and how RFID cards work at the 125KHz frequency. 

The goal of this project is to read a 125KHz RFID card and extract the card number, faculty code, and the tag ID (like what you would see when scanning an RFID card with a Proxmark3). It would have been possible to look at manuals and the Proxmark3 source code and figure out how it decodes cards. However, I learn better from doing a project myself, so I decided to build a tool (with the help of some existing code). This project was based off code written by Daniel Smith (www.pagemac.com) in 2012.

This code is open source and can freely be reused and distributed without any expectation of warranty. If you find a way to make the code better, please share the updates with us so we can continue to learn and keep the project growing.

If you are interested in RFID chips, human implantable chips, or working with Arduino code please consider checking out our YouTube channel and following along with some of our projects.
